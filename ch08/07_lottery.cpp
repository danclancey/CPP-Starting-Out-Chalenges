/*
Write a program that simulates a lottery. The program should have an 
array of five integers named winningDigits, with a randomly generated 
number in the range of 0 through 9 for each element in the array. The 
program should ask the user to enter five digits and should store them 
in a second integer array named player. The program must compare the 
corresponding elements in the two arrays and count how many digits 
match. For example, the following shows the winningDigits array and the 
Player array with sample numbers stored in each. There are two matching 
digits, elements 2 and 4.

        WinningDigits	7	4	9	1	3
        player	        4	2	9	7	3

Once the user has entered a set of numbers, the program should display 
the winning digits and the playerâ€™s digits and tell how many digits matched.
