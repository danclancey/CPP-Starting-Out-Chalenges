/*
The following formula can be used to determine the distance an object falls due to gravity in a specific time period:

                d = 1/2 * gt^2

The variables in the formula are as follows:
    d is the distance in meters,
    g is 9.8,
    and t is the time in seconds that the object has been falling.

Write a function named fallingDistance that accepts an objectâ€™s falling time (in seconds) as an argument. 
The function should return the distance, in meters, that the object has fallen during that time interval. 
Write a program that demonstrates the function by calling it in a loop that passes the values 1 through 
10 as arguments and displays the return value.
*/

#include <iostream>
#include <iomanip>

double fallingDistance (int seconds);

int main () {
    
    std::cout << std::fixed << std::setprecision(2);
    for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
        std::cout << i << " seconds : " << fallingDistance(i) << " meters\n";  
    }

    return 0;
}

double fallingDistance(int seconds) {
    return (1.0 / 2.0) * ( 9.8 * (seconds * seconds));
}
