/*
  The date June 10, 1960, is special because when we write it in the following format, the month times the 
  day equals the year.

        6/10/60

  Write a program that asks the user to enter a month (in numeric form), a day, and a two-digit year. The program 
  should then determine whether the month times the day is equal to the year. If so, it should display a message 
  saying the date is magic. Otherwise, it should display a message saying the date is not magic. Test your program 
  with some dates that are magic and some that are not.

  Input Validation: Think about what legal values the program should accept for month and day.
