/*
  Create a change-counting game that asks the user to enter what coins to use to make exactly one dollar. 
  The program should ask the user to enter the number of pennies, nickels, dimes, and quarters. If the 
  total value of the coins entered is equal to one dollar, the program should congratulate the user for 
  winning the game. Otherwise, the program should display a message indicating whether the amount entered 
  was more or less than one dollar. Use constant variables to hold the coin values.
