/*
  Write a program that asks for the number of calories and fat grams in a food and then displays what 
  percentage of the calories come from fat. If the calories from fat are less than 30 percent of the 
  total calories, it should also display a message indicating the food is low in fat.

  One gram of fat has 9 calories, so:

      Calories from fat = fat grams * 9

  The percentage of calories from fat can be calculated as:

      Calories from fat รท total calories

  Input Validation: The number of calories from fat cannot be greater than the total calories.
