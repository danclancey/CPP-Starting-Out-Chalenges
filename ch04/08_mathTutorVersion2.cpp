/*
  Write a program that can be used as a math tutor for a young student. The program should display two 
  random numbers between 10 and 50 that are to be added, such as:

            24
           +12
          -----
 
  The program should then wait for the student to enter the answer. If the answer is correct, a message 
  of congratulations should be printed. If the answer is incorrect, a message should be printed showing 
  the correct answer.
