/*
  A mobile phone service has three different data plans for its customers:

      Plan A:	For $39.99 per month, 2 gigabytes are provided. Additional usage costs $8.00 per gigabyte.
      Plan B:	For $59.99 per month, 8 gigabytes are provided. Additional usage costs $8.00 per gigabyte.
      Plan C:	For $79.99 per month, unlimited data is provided.
  
  Write a program that calculates a customerâ€™s monthly bill. It should input the customer name, which plan 
  was purchased, and how many gigabytes were used. It should then create a bill that includes the input 
  information and the total amount due. It should also display how much money plan A customers would save 
  if they purchased plan B or C, and how much money plan B customers would save if they purchased plan C. 
  If there would be no savings, no message should be printed. Wherever possible, use named constants 
  instead of numbers.
