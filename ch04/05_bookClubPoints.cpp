  An online book club awards points to its customers based on the number of books purchased each month. 
  Points are awarded as follows:

            Books           Purchased	Points Earned
            0 	            0
            1 	            5
            2 	            15
            3 	            30
            4 or more	      50

  Write a program that asks the user to enter the number of books purchased this month and then displays 
  the number of points awarded.
