/*
  If a scientist knows the wavelength of an electromagnetic wave, she can determine what type of radiation 
  it is. Write a program that asks for the wavelength in meters of an electromagnetic wave and then 
  displays what that wave is according to the following chart. (For example, a wave with a wavelength of 
  1E-10 meters would be an X-ray.)

               1x10^-11       1x10^-8         4x10^-7       7x10^-7          7x10^-3        1x10^-2
