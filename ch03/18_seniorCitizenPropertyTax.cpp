/*
  Madison County provides a $5000 homeowner exemption for senior citizens. For example, if their house is 
  valued at $158,000 its assessed value would be $94,800, as explained above. However they would only pay 
  tax on $89,800. At last yearâ€™s tax rate of $2.64 for each $100 of assessed value, their property tax 
  would be $2370.72. In addition to the tax break, senior citizens are allowed to pay their property tax in 
  four equal payments. The quarterly payment due on this property would be $592.68. Write a program that 
  asks the user to input the actual value of a piece of property and the current tax rate for each $100 of 
  assessed value. The program should then calculate and report how much annual property tax a senior 
  homeowner will be charged for this property and what their quarterly tax bill will be.
