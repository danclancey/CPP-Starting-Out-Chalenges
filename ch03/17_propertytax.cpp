/*
  Madison County collects property taxes on the assessed value of property, which is 60 percent of its actual value. 
  For example, if a house is valued at $158,000, its assessed value is $94,800. This is the amount the homeowner 
  pays tax on. At last yearâ€™s tax rate of $2.64 for each $100 of assessed value, the annual property tax for this 
  house would be $2502.72. Write a program that asks the user to input the actual value of a piece of property and 
  the current tax rate for each $100 of assessed value. The program should then calculate and report how much annual 
  property tax the homeowner will be charged for this property.
